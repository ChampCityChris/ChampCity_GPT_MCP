# Tool Reference

HTTP clients reach these tools through `/mcp`. In ChatGPT HTTP mode, `/mcp` requires an OAuth bearer access token; unauthenticated localhost testing requires explicit `CHAMPCITY_GPT_ALLOW_UNAUTH_LOCAL_HTTP=true` and must not be tunneled. Keep write mode `off` until the read-only HTTP flow is validated.

OAuth metadata:

```text
/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
/oauth/register
/oauth/authorize
/oauth/token
```

Scope mapping:

- `files.read`: `tools/list`, `list_project_files`, `read_project_file`, `search_project_files`, `git_status`, `git_diff`, and `get_write_access_status`.
- `files.write`: `propose_patch`, `write_markdown_artifact`, `apply_approved_patch`, and `run_allowed_script`.

Write access has OAuth plus local write-mode gates. `CHAMPCITY_GPT_WRITE_MODE=off|docs|patch|elevated` is preferred, with `config/write-access.local.json` as the local-file source. Legacy `CHAMPCITY_GPT_ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true` maps to `docs`.

- `off`: no writes.
- `docs`: Markdown artifact writes.
- `patch`: docs plus application of matching pending patch proposals.
- `elevated`: scripts and legacy approval-gated fallback operations.

The elevated approval token is configured in `config/write-access.local.json` as a salted hash, or temporarily through `CHAMPCITY_GPT_WRITE_APPROVAL_TOKEN` for dev/manual testing. Static bearer tokens are legacy/manual testing only; ChatGPT.com uses OAuth.

## `list_project_files`

Lists files under an allowed root or subdirectory. Returns relative paths only and excludes blocked directories, sensitive files, symlinks, and file contents.

Input:

```json
{
  "root": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\Projects\\<another-project>",
  "relativePath": ".",
  "glob": "**/*",
  "maxResults": 200
}
```

Output summary: selected root, relative directory, file list, and `truncated`.

## `read_project_file`

Reads one text file from an allowed root after path, file policy, binary, and size checks.

Input:

```json
{
  "root": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\Projects\\<another-project>",
  "relativePath": "src/example.ts",
  "maxBytes": 200000
}
```

Output summary: relative path, size, modified time, SHA-256, and contents.

## `search_project_files`

Searches allowed text files with literal string matching and limited context lines.

Input:

```json
{
  "root": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\Projects\\<another-project>",
  "query": "Narrator Rejection",
  "glob": "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,md}",
  "maxResults": 50,
  "contextLines": 2
}
```

Output summary: matches with relative path, line number, matched line, context, and `truncated`.

## `propose_patch`

Generates a unified diff from safe text replacements without modifying files, then registers a short-lived patch proposal. The returned `proposalId` and `patchHash` can be used by `apply_approved_patch` in patch write mode.

Input:

```json
{
  "root": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\Projects\\<another-project>",
  "changes": [
    {
      "relativePath": "src/example.ts",
      "originalText": "old text",
      "replacementText": "new text"
    }
  ]
}
```

Output summary: `patch`, `proposalId`, `patchHash`, `affectedFiles`, and `expiresAt`.

Safety behavior: target files must be allowed readable text files, and `originalText` must be present. The server stores only proposal metadata and the SHA-256 of the exact patch text in `config/pending-patches.local.json`.

## `apply_approved_patch`

Applies a patch only when local write mode is `patch` or `elevated` and the patch matches a registered proposal from `propose_patch`, or when elevated approval is explicitly configured.

Input:

```json
{
  "root": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\Projects\\<another-project>",
  "patch": "...unified diff...",
  "proposalId": "uuid-from-propose_patch",
  "patchHash": "sha256-from-propose_patch"
}
```

Output summary: changed files and post-apply git diff summary.

Safety behavior: in `patch` mode the patch must exactly match a non-expired unused proposal for the same root. The proposal is marked used after successful apply. All existing patch checks still run: allowed-root, blocked-file, regular-file, symlink/submodule, size, and non-git-target checks when git enforcement is enabled. After applying, changed paths are checked with `lstat`, and symbolic link paths are rejected with a best-effort rollback. In `elevated` mode, a valid elevated approval token can be used as a high-risk fallback without a proposal match.

Review behavior: write operations should still be reviewed with `git diff` before commit.

## `write_markdown_artifact`

Writes a Markdown artifact when OAuth `files.write` is granted and local write mode is `docs`, `patch`, or `elevated`.

Input:

```json
{
  "root": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\Projects\\<project>",
  "relativePath": "docs/EXAMPLE.md",
  "content": "# Example",
  "overwrite": false
}
```

Output summary: relative path, size, and SHA-256.

Safety behavior: allowed roots, `.md`-only writes, blocked-file policy, overwrite rules, atomic write, and audit logging. No `approvalToken` is required for Markdown writes in `docs`, `patch`, or `elevated` mode.

## `get_write_access_status`

Returns the server-side write-mode status without exposing secrets.

Input:

```json
{}
```

Output summary: `writeMode`, `writeModeSource`, docs/patch/elevated booleans, whether the elevated token is configured, pending patch proposal count, and `oauthFilesWriteGranted` as `unknown` when the tool layer cannot see OAuth context.

## `git_status`

Runs fixed git inspection commands for an allowed root.

Input:

```json
{
  "root": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\Projects\\<another-project>"
}
```

Output summary: current branch and `git status --short` output.

## `git_diff`

Returns unstaged or staged git diff with truncation.

Input:

```json
{
  "root": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\Projects\\<another-project>",
  "staged": false,
  "maxBytes": 300000
}
```

Output summary: diff text and `truncated`.

## `run_allowed_script`

Runs only commands exactly listed in `CHAMPCITY_GPT_ALLOWED_COMMANDS`, without shell interpolation, and only in elevated write mode with required elevated approval. It is never available in `docs` or `patch` mode.

Input:

```json
{
  "root": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\Projects\\<another-project>",
  "command": "npm test",
  "timeoutSeconds": 120,
  "approvalToken": "temporary-token"
}
```

Output summary: stdout, stderr, exit code, timeout flag, and truncation flag.
